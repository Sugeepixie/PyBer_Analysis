# PyBer_Challenge

## Overview of Project
  The Purpose of this analysis was to identify ride sharing metrics such as total number of rides, total drivers, total fares, avarage fare per ride, and avarage fare per driver by city types and also generate a line graph visualization of weekly fares based on city types.

 ## PyBer_Analysis Results
 
   Image 1

 * The ride sharing metrics shows that 
    * The Urban cities shows high number of drivers yileding highest total fare bringing the avarage fare per driver and per ride low compared to other cities
    * The rural cities shows shortage in drivers which brought down the number of rides hiking the avarage fare

* The line graph shows that 
   * The urban citties got highest total fare 
   * The rural has the lowest total fare
   * There is a peak in all city types during the last weeks of February
   * The urban cities seems to show peak and sudden drop between March and April



 ## PyBer_Analysis Summary
    
  * Recommendations :
   *  Pyber needs to investigate the reason for low driver count /lower number of rides in the rural cities and draft a plan to make ride sharing afforadable and accessible in all cities
   * Encouraging more drivers to drive in the rural citites
   * Investing more in urban cities to yield more profit
